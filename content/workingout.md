It's a common misconception that working out will make you lose weight. In
fact, if you're not careful, working out can actually make you gain weight.
Here's how it happens:

When you work out, you burn calories. This is a good thing, of course. But if
you don't replenish those calories with food, your body will start to break
down muscle for energy. And muscle tissue is heavier than fat tissue, so you
could end up gaining weight even as you're working out.

To avoid this, make sure you're eating enough to fuel your workouts. A
combination of healthy carbs and proteins will give you the energy you need to
work out without causing weight gain. And of course, don't forget to stay
hydrated. Drinking plenty of water will help your body stay healthy and prevent
water retention, which can also lead to weight gain.

So, if you're working out and not seeing the weight loss you want, make sure
you're not inadvertently gaining weight. Eating right and staying hydrated are
key to keeping your body healthy and your weight under control.
